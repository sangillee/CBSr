Description: Package for using Cubic Bezier Spline as a function approximator especially in modeling latent utility functions.
    While Cubic Bezier Splines (CBS) are heavily used in the graphics software industry, it can also be used as a flexible function
    approximation tool given the right constraints. The CBS package provides a method to calculate the y value from a x value given
    an appropriately constrained CBS curve. It then uses this method to approximate latent utility functions in intertemporal choice
    and risky choice data. Lee, Glaze, Bradlow, Kable, (2019) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/2ugwr>.
