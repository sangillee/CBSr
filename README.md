# CBSr 1.0.3

R Package for using Cubic Bezier Spline as a function approximator especially in modeling latent utility functions.  
While Cubic Bezier Splines (CBS) are heavily used in the graphics software industry, it can also be used as a flexible  
function approximation tool given the right constraints. The CBS package provides a method to calculate the y value  
from a x value given an appropriately constrained CBS curve. It then uses this method to approximate latent utility  
functions in intertemporal choice and risky choice data.
